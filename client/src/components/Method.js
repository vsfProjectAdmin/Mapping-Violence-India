      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
        Violence per square feet is a community sourced project that documents violence and discrimination against the minorities in India.
      </p>
      <h2 className="mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold">What is violence and discrimination against minorities for the purpose of this documentation project?</h2>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
        Any act that is committed against a person, a group, a group of people, business, property, or place of worship belonging to a minority population, whether it results in physical harm or not or whether it is legally permissible or not. Legally permissible or not would entail incidents like demolition of homes of protestors, demolition drives in the name of ‘encroachment’, extra judicial murders (police encounters) or demolition of mazaars by non-state actors [not exhaustive].
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
        A minority should be understood in relative terms of power: for example, certain minorities groups, such as Dalits, can indulge in violence/discrimination against Muslims. At the same time, Muslims can be a source of violence/discrimination against Dalits.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
      In cases where state power- police, judiciary, law- is employed to inflict violence, discriminate against or further marginalize the minorities, the category of state violence should be used.       
      </p>
      <h2 className="mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold">How do I enter the incident that I just witnessed/read about/ watched a video of/ heard from somewhere?</h2>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
      A few points to consider:      
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
      1. The user should first choose from the list of categories to assign a broad attribute to violence. This mainly pertains to how the violence can be perceived in the first instance: 
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-4 text-gray-600">
          <li>Caste based discrimination</li>
          <li>Caste based violence</li>
          <li>Religious discrimination</li>
          <li>Hate/Hate Crimes by the majoritarian community</li>
          <li>Vigilante violence</li>
          <li>Sexual violence</li>
          <li>State/Police violence</li>
          <li>Other violence</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
      2. The second step involves a more detailed categorisation into sub-categories. This pertains to how the violence can be best described through the sub-categories. Here, the user can choose more than one option to assign different categories under which one can list the incident. For example, an incident of ‘a genocidal speech by a politician X’ would ideally occur under the category ‘Hate/Hate Crimes by the majoritarian community but at the same time a user can further describe the event through categories of ‘Hate speech’, ‘Islamophobia’ and ‘Incitement to violence against religious minorities’.       
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
      Next step would be briefly describing the incident that you are reporting. This could be 2-3 lines about what the incident was, where it occurred (if possible, the exact location, like name of the school, or university), and who were the perpetrators (names of politicians, political party, organization, or people).       </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
      If there is source: newspaper cutting, video clip, online media, Instagram or X, please add it to ‘source’. In case you are ‘self-reporting’ the incident, please enter your correct email address so that we can be in touch with you to get a more detailed version of the incident.  
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
      The date of the incident should match the one given in source. In case you cannot accurately input when the incident occurred, give the closest date possible. We will try to correct the date as per the source cited and the occurrence of that incident in other sources. Once the submission has been made, it will be reviewed backhand before it appears on the website. Reviewing of the data backhand will also allow us to do away with duplicate data.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
      For the location, choose from the list of states and enter the city on your own.  
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
      Press ‘submit’, and your incident is reported. 
      </p>
      <h2 className="mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold">Data sources and data ownership</h2>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
